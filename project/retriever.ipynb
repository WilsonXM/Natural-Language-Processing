Given:  Principal amount  𝑃 = 10000 P=10000 dollars Quarterly compound interest rate  𝑟 = 4 % r=4% or  0.04 0.04 The interest is compounded quarterly. First, calculate the quarterly interest:  Quarterly interest = 𝑃 × 𝑟 = 10000 × 0.04 = 400  dollars Quarterly interest=P×r=10000×0.04=400 dollars Since this interest is compounded quarterly, after 1 year (4 quarters), the amount owed will include interest compounded on the previous quarters' interest.  To find the annual interest, we need to calculate the future value  𝐹 𝑉 FV of the loan after 1 year with quarterly compounding:  𝐹 𝑉 = 𝑃 ( 1 + 𝑟 4 ) 4 FV=P(1+  4 r ​  )  4   Substituting the values:  𝐹 𝑉 = 10000 ( 1 + 0.04 4 ) 4 FV=10000(1+  4 0.04 ​  )  4    𝐹 𝑉 = 10000 ( 1 + 0.01 ) 4 FV=10000(1+0.01)  4    𝐹 𝑉 = 10000 ( 1.01 ) 4 FV=10000(1.01)  4   Calculating  ( 1.01 ) 4 (1.01)  4  :  ( 1.01 ) 4 ≈ 1.04060401 (1.01)  4  ≈1.04060401 So,  𝐹 𝑉 ≈ 10000 × 1.04060401 = 10406.0401  dollars FV≈10000×1.04060401=10406.0401 dollars Now, calculate the interest paid annually:  Annual interest = 𝐹 𝑉 − 𝑃 = 10406.0401 − 10000 = 406.0401  dollars Annual interest=FV−P=10406.0401−10000=406.0401 dollars Approximating to whole dollars, the annual interest Carl pays is approximately..

      "C) 12 - This could be the product if X is 1 and Y is 2 (or vice versa), making the number 812 or 821, but only 821 would violate the divisibility by 2 rule since Y needs to be even. So, 812 is a possibility.\n",
